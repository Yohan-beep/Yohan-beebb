            <li><b>Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you think you can combine this with studying?</b></li>
         
            Yes, I do indeed plan to work alongside my studies. I like to read about sports, political history and day to day politics during my leisure time. I can combine my leisurely activities with studies by staying more organised with how I spend my time every day. I would also need to prioritise my tasks and divide my time between each activity in order to maintain a healthy balance.
